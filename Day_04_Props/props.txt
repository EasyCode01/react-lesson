What is props?
Props is a special keyword in React that stands for properties and is being used to pass 
data from one component to another and mostly from parent component to child component. 
We can say props is a data carrier or a means to transport data.
Most of the time, functions with parameters are smart and they can take dynamic data 
likewise props is a way we pass data or parameter to a component.

const User = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>
        {props.firstName}
        {props.lastName}
      </h1>
      <small>{props.country}</small>
    </div>
  )
}
<User firstName = 'Asabeneh', lastName='Yetayeh' country = 'Finland' />

Props object
React props is an object which you get instantly when you create a React component. 
Before we pass properties to the component, let's check what do we get in the props object.

In the above console.log(props), you would get an empty object({}). 
That means if you do not pass any attributes or properties when you instantiate the component, 
the props will be empty otherwise it will be populated with the data you passed as attributes 
and the proper name of these attributes are props.
