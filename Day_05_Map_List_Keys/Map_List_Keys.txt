Mapping arrays
In React, we use map to modify an array to list of JSX by adding a certain HTML elements 
to each element of an array.
Most of the time data is in the form of an array or an array of objects. To render this 
array or array of objects most of the time we modify the data using map. 

Mapping array of numbers
1. create an Array of numbers in  the Parent Components
2. Pass it as a prop to the Number child component and render it

Mapping An Array of Objects
const countries = [
  { name: 'Finland', city: 'Helsinki' },
  { name: 'Sweden', city: 'Stockholm' },
  { name: 'Denmark', city: 'Copenhagen' },
  { name: 'Norway', city: 'Oslo' },
  { name: 'Iceland', city: 'Reykjav√≠k' },
]

Key in mapping arrays
Keys help React to identify items which have changed, added, or removed. 
Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity. 
The key should be unique. Mostly data will come with as an id and we can use id as key. 
If we do not pass key to React during mapping it raises a warning on the browser. 
If the data does not have an id we have to find a way to create a unique identifier 
for each element when we map it. See the following example:


Exercise:
1. Create the following hexadecimal colors using React component
2. 1.Make the following bar group using the given data

export const tenHighestPopulation = [
  { country: 'World', population: 7693165599 },
  { country: 'China', population: 1377422166 },
  { country: 'India', population: 1295210000 },
  { country: 'United States of America', population: 323947000 },
  { country: 'Indonesia', population: 258705000 },
  { country: 'Brazil', population: 206135893 },
  { country: 'Pakistan', population: 194125062 },
  { country: 'Nigeria', population: 186988000 },
  { country: 'Bangladesh', population: 161006790 },
  { country: 'Russian Federation', population: 146599183 },
  { country: 'Japan', population: 126960000 },
