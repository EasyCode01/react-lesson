React Router
he literal meaning of route is a path or a way to get to somewhere. The meaning in React is also 
similar to the literal meaning. React Router is by itself a React component which allows you to 
navigate between React components.

As we have cleared out the very beginning that React is a single page application which has only one
 index.html page in the entire application. When we implement a React Router the different components 
 get render on the index.html page at same time or different time base on different logic and conditions.
  React Router has different versions and the latest version is React Router 6.

  BroswerRouter
BrowerRouter is a parent component which allows to wrap the application route. Using the BrowserRouter 
we can access the browser history. Sometimes it can renames as router. 

Routes
The Routes component allows only on component to be rendered.

Route(exact)
The Route component allows to navigate between components. It is a pathway from one component to another. 
The Route component has two required props: the path and component or render. The path props is where 
the component has to be rendered and the component props is the component which has to be rendered in 
that specific path.
