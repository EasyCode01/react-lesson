Components
A React component is a small, reusable code, which is responsible for one part of the 
application UI. A React application is an aggregation of components. React can help us 
to build reusable components. In React we assemble different components 
together to create an application. We use JavaScript functions or classes to make components. 
If we use a function, the component will be a functional component, but if we use a class, 
the component will be a class-based component.

Big picture of components
 If we have a million-dollar button, we can use this button all the time, instead of
  recreating it all over again, whenever we need a button. The same goes for input fields, 
  forms, header or footer. That is where the power of the component comes. 


React Functional Components
Using a JavaScript function, we can make a functional React component.

// React component syntax
// it can be arrow function, function declaration or function expression
const jsx = <tag> Content </tag>
const ComponentName = () => {
  return jsx
}

The following expression is a JSX element.

// JSX element, header
const header = (
  <header style={headerStyles}>
    <div className='header-wrapper'>
      <h1>Welcome to 30 Days Of React</h1>
      <h2>Getting Started React</h2>
      <h3>JavaScript Library</h3>
      <p>Asabeneh Yetayeh</p>
      <small>Oct 3, 2020</small>
    </div>
  </header>
)

// React Component
const Header = () => {
  return header
}

or

// Explicitly returning the JSX
const Header = () => (
  <header style={headerStyles}>
    <div className='header-wrapper'>
      <h1>Welcome to 30 Days Of React</h1>
      <h2>Getting Started React</h2>
      <h3>JavaScript Library</h3>
      <p>Asabeneh Yetayeh</p>
      <small>Oct 3, 2020</small>
    </div>
  </header>
)

Further on Functional components
What is the smallest size of a component? A component that returns only a single HTML as 
JSX is considered as a small component. A button component or an alert box component, or 
just an input field component.

const Button = () => <button>action</button>
const buttonStyles = {
  padding: '10px 20px',
  background: 'rgb(0, 255, 0'),
  border: 'none',
  borderRadius: 5,
}
const Button = () => <button style={buttonStyles}> action </button>

The Button component is a dumb component, because it does not take any parameters and we 
cannot change the action text dynamically. We need to pass props to the button, to change 
the value dynamically.
